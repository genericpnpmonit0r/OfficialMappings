Most of the mapped names are based off the b1.2_02 test build. 
Methods and classes introduced in b1.3 are mapped from various name sources, including MCPE / legacy console edition debug symbols.
(same for the serverside only classes)
(field names for things introduced after b1.2_02 are guesstimated)
(argument/parameter names are guessed and or incomplete)
