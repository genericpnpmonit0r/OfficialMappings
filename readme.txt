Most of the mapped names are based off the b1.2_02 test build. 
Methods and classes introduced in b1.3 are mapped from various name sources, including MCPE / legacy console edition debug symbols.
(same for the serverside only classes)
(field names for things introduced after b1.2_02 are guesstimated)
(argument/parameter names are guessed and or incomplete)

SHA256 hashes of the JARs if anyone wants to contribute:

Client JAR SHA256: E993B789DD450E1538667DEF644E1376BD702FE26EEBEC3197598D5157042684
Server JAR SHA256: 4CAC207200BD058B6EEE9DAB6FFC50CE2B64CDA33AD2A65231B2A68EAEF536F8
PC Gamer Demo JAR SHA256: C2C77DEE7FF48FDE9558C0D1967DB8D51D3C4B12905C05C9A08561551B3E7CF3

(PC Gamer Demo build is forked off b1.3 / b1.3_01 and so the mappings are very similar)
